The following file outlines some of the changes that should be made to
barrel, before we can promote a version to 1.0.  This is in no way an
exhausive list, but certainly a good starting point for contributors
to work with.  There are several sections of issues, some of which
were already reported on the repo, others have not.


== Bugs

- https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/79
- https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/80
- https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/81
- https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/82
- https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/83


== Features

- Tests should run against a database backend, not just a static
  string.  This way we can also enforce compatibility with a specific
  database version.

- *Testing*: The tests should run against an actual database to make




sure that the syntax is valid. We still run into syntax issues from time to
   time. As also mentioned here:
   https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/issues/8#issue-297373013
   - *Integrate Fork*: One of our freelancers was working with barrel for
   some time and eventually had to create a fork in order to do fixes.
   Currently we are using his fork but I would really like to switch back to
   mainline barrel asap.
   - Merge his PRs if possible:
      https://github.com/rust-db/barrel/pulls/aknuds1
      - There are probably other fixes he has not opened a PR for. Those
      should be ported as well. Maybe you can scan his history to see what is
      needed. https://github.com/aknuds1/barrel/commits/master
