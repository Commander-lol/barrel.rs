A schema migration builder for Rust. Write complicated SQL schema migrations in Rust and easily switch databases.

## Example

The API was recently completely changed (**again**). The current iteration of the API can be seen below. Some of the functions might not fully work yet or need tweaking. In fact, a lot of the functions haven't been properly hooked up yet ðŸ˜…

```rust
extern crate barrel;

use barrel::*;

fn main() {
    let mut m = Migration::new();
    m.create_table("users", |t| {
        t.add_column("name", Type::Text);
        t.add_column("age", Type::Integer);
        t.add_column("owns_plushy_sharks", Type::Boolean);
    });

    // I like plushy sharks
    m.rename_table("sharks", "plushies");
}

```

If you have feedback regarding the API or things you would want barrel to do, please open an issue. And documentation PR's are always welcome ðŸ’š
