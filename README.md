A powerful schema migration builder for Rust. Write complicated SQL schema migrations in Rust and easily switch databases.

`barrel` is meant to make writing migrations for different databases as easy as possible. It creates a simple to use API over SQL which allows you to focus on managing your database, not fighting with SQL.


## Example

The following code is a simple example of how to get going with `barrel`

```rust
extern crate barrel;

use barrel::*;
use barrel::backend::Pg;

fn main() {
    let mut m = Migration::new();
    m.create_table("users", |t| {
        t.add_column("name", Type::Text);
        t.add_column("age", Type::Integer);
        t.add_column("owns_plushy_sharks", Type::Boolean);
    });

    println!("{}", m.make::<Pg>());
}
```

If you have feedback regarding the API or things you would want barrel to do, please open an issue. And documentation PR's are always welcome ðŸ’š
